			On the first roll, if a player gets a 2, 3, or 12, they loose. If they get a 7, 11, or 14 they win. If neither situation happens the result is know as the player point and the player has too roll again. On subsequent rolls, if a player rolls a 7, they loose, if they roll the 'Player Point', they win. If neither happens the player continues to roll using the original player point until they win or loose.
